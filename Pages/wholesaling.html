		<h1>Wholesaling/Assigning
		 
		</div>
		</h1>
			<p>Wholesaling is great for beginner investors because it is one of the least complex strategies with little to no risk, and costs absolutely NO MONEY. Wholesaling is essentially a basic flip, but with no repairs. Wholesaling typically involves getting a house under contract, then selling it to another investor.</p>
		<h3>Before you start.</h3>
			<p>Before wholesaling any properties, always have your ducks in a row. First, make sure you have a list of investors to market your properties to. Also always have a backup plan in case you can’t find an investor to assign the contract to. Have back up financing options such as hard money or private money, even a bank loan will do. The last thing you want to do is tell your seller that you couldn’t find a buyer and then worst case, they get foreclosed on. </p>	 
		<h3>What is wholesaling?</h3>
			 <p>A Wholesale or Assignment is getting a property under contract, which then gives the wholesaler “equitable interest.” This allows the wholesaler to transfer the property to another party with permission from the legal property owner. To be clear, wholesalers do not have the right to sell, rent, or advertise the property. They can only transfer the property. Then Assign or transfer that contract to another investor for a “finder’s fee.” The fee can range anywhere from 5k-50k depending on the profit margin that the property has. </p>
		<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
			<p>Your reputation is the only thing at risk when doing these types of deals. If you told a motivated seller that you will sell their property, then that is what is expected. ALWAYS be true to your word because your reputation is one of your most valuable assets as an investor.</p>
		<h3>What are the costs?</h3>
			<p>The only cost is the cost of marketing for a distressed seller.
		Wholesale deals need equity!
			Wholesaling works best with properties that have equity, because without equity there isn’t opportunity to make a profit. I will give 2 examples to show what I mean.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Exp. 1:   Loan value: $190k</li>
			<li>ARV: $240K</li>
			<li>Assignment fee: $5k</li>
			<li>Closing cost (front and back): $5k</li>
			<li>Holding cost: $10k</li>
			<li>Repairs: $15k</li>
			<li>Investor price: $200k</li>
			<li>Seller portion: $10k</li>
			<li>(Remember the bank always gets paid first!)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			If you subtract all of the costs ($235k) from the loan value ($240k), that leaves the investor with a measly $5k profit. I promise you that no good investor will want to buy this kind of deal from a wholesaler. This is also assuming that the seller walks away from the property with only $10k! Let’s look at a more promising example.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Exp. 2:  Loan value: $72k</li>
			<li>ARV: $240k</li>
			<li>Assignment fee: $5k</li>
			<li>Closing cost (front and Back): $5k</li>
			<li>Holding cost: $10k</li>
			<li>Repairs: $15k</li>
			<li>Investor price: $168k</li>
			<li>Seller portion: $96k ($168k-$72k)</li>
		</ul>
			<p>In this example if you subtract the total cost ($203k) from the selling price ($240k) that will leave the investor with a nice $37k profit. This would be a great wholesale deal.</p>
		<h3>What kind of properties have equity?</h3>
			<p>A wholesaler should be targeting properties that have had the same owner for many years. This means that the owner has been paying the mortgage for many years which will give the property more equity.
		<span>Disclaimer
			Although wholesaling is a beginner’s strategy, that doesn’t mean that it’s easy for an uneducated investor. Always seek guidance from a professional before going through one of these deals.  Make sure you are doing everything legally and efficiently.</span></p>
		<h2>Review.</h2>
			<p>Let’s review what we’ve learned about wholesaling. First and foremost, find a property with equity and a motivated seller. The second step is to get that property under contract to get equitable interest. Third you must find an investor willing to buy the property. If all goes well then the wholesaler will get paid their assignment fee at closing.</p>
